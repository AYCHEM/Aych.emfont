Mailpile Fonts
==============

This repository represents fonts developed by and for Mailpile in collaboration with various font designers and our team.

## Mailpile

Our first and only font is called **Mailpile** and was based on the awesome free font Fauna One made by [Eduardo Rodr√≠guez Tunni](http://www.tipo.net.ar/). The goal was to create something closer the slab-serif font [Museo](http://www.exljbris.com/museo.html) which we had used in our branding but were unable to bundle in the Mailpile source code due to a [licensing conflict](http://www.mailpile.is/blog/2013-08-30_Fonts_and_Copyright_Licenses.html).

We were first aided by font master [Richard Fink](http://readableweb.com/) which our designer [Brennan Novak](https://brennannovak.com) refined to it's current state. The font is not done yet, but was good enough for us to move into the Mailpile codebase and remove Museo.

#### Font Roadmap

* Refine various curves that are a bit rough
* Refine & normalize thickness of current font
* Fix alignment of special characters
* Create bold (700) weight
* Create medium (500) weight
